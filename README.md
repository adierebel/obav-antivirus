# ObAV Antivirus

This is classic ObAV Anti-virus source code, made with classic VB6, x86 ASM, and C.

## Story Behind

This is an antivirus created by [ojixzzz](https://github.com/ojixzzz) as founder and [adierebel](https://github.com/adierebel) as co-founder. This software was created when the founder was 16 years old, and the co-founder was 13 years old.

Ten years later, one of them started a conversation. *"Hey, ten years ago we did an anti-virus, and I still have the source code."*

And the others answered. *"So why do we publish it on Github and archive it?"*

This is a hobby project, so you will notice that the source code is less organized.
